          My name is No√© Landaverde and I am a Mexican Geoinformatics Engineer.
          Although my profession is heavily oriented towards Geographic Information
          Systems and Cartography, my job experience and postgraduate education were
          focused more on the technological/visual aspect of its core: analysing & processing
          geographic information and developing web applications for visualization and
          cartographic purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself open-minded, versatile and adaptable very adaptable, as well
          as always looking forward to learning more and improving in all aspects possible.
